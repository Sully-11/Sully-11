- 👀 I’m interested in automation, sorting, and organization of data.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to utilize an API to give me concise access to all of the movies I could watch tonight with my wife.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on automation of cell phones using Tasker-like applications.
- 📫 How to reach me: bballcon13@gmail.com is currently full of subscriptions from a decade ago, but I'm working on cleaning it out.
